# DX12Playground

To run this app you need DirectX 12 SDK installed on your computer, and you should be able to run this right away from .sln file. 
In case of errors you need to add include and lib directories to project, you can find their macros here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn899120(v=vs.85).aspx
In this app I'm using static libraries.

Have fun playing with this!:)
